= SemVer
:toc: preamble

http://semver.org/[Semantic versioning] is a standard to give version numbers
meaning. To work with these versions, the `SemVer` class comes into play. It
will deal with incrementing the version for you, and making it easy to work
with it programmatically.

== Installation
Use `zef`, the Perl 6 module installer:

[source]
----
# zef install SemVer
----

== Usage
[source,perl6]
----
use SemVer;

# Create a new SemVer from a string
my SemVer $v .= new("1.12.3");
              # new(1, 12, 3); # Alternative method

say $v.Str; # "1.12.3";

# Increment the patch level
$v.bump-patch;

say $v.Str; # "1.12.4"

# Increment minor level
$v.bump-minor;

say $v.Str; # "1.13.0"

# Increment major level
$v.bump-major;

say $v.Str; # "2.0.0"
